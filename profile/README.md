# Hi, I'm AWS-Sensei

I am building AWS-Sensei to make AWS learning clear, practical, and consistent.
This organization is my public workspace for flashcards, labs, blog posts, and
supporting infrastructure. If you are learning or teaching AWS, I hope these
resources save you time and help you build real skills.

## What you will find here
